# Bulldozer Price Prediction
Project Overview
This project builds a Machine Learning model to predict the price of bulldozers based on historical sales data. The goal is to help businesses and individuals estimate the market value of bulldozers, enabling better decision-making.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
Model Used: RandomForestRegressor
Notebook: Jupyter Notebook

Dataset
The dataset contains historical auction prices for bulldozers, along with relevant features such as year of manufacture, usage hours, machine type, and location.
Data source: (Mention the source if applicable, e.g., Kaggle or any other dataset provider)

Key Features
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and encoding categorical variables.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing price trends and identifying key factors influencing price fluctuations.
Model Training & Evaluation: Using RandomForestRegressor to achieve high prediction accuracy.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model performance for better generalization.

Results & Insights
The model accurately predicts bulldozer prices with a high RÂ² score.
Key factors influencing price: Machine Age, Usage Hours, Sale Date, and Machine Type.

Future Improvements
Implement feature selection for further optimization.
Try XGBoost or Deep Learning models for comparison.
Deploy the model as a web app for real-time price prediction.
